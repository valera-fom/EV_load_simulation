# EV Load Forecasting Simulation

A comprehensive Streamlit application for simulating Electric Vehicle (EV) charging load forecasting with advanced Time of Use (ToU) optimization and multiple charging strategies.

## Features

### ðŸš— EV Simulation
- **Dynamic EV Fleet Modeling** - Simulate realistic EV populations with varying battery capacities and charging rates
- **Multiple EV Models** - Support for different EV types with configurable parameters
- **Charging Infrastructure** - Various charger types and power levels

### âš¡ Time of Use (ToU) Optimization
- **Interactive Timeline** - 24-hour period assignment with visual color coding
- **Multiple Period Types** - Super Off-Peak, Off-Peak, Mid-Peak, and Peak periods
- **Smart Car Distribution** - Automatic proportional splitting of EVs among multiple periods of the same type
- **Real-time Adoption Rates** - Configurable adoption percentages for each period

### ðŸ”‹ Advanced Charging Strategies
